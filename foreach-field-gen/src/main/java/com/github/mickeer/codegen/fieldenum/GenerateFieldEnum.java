/**
 * For each class annotated with this annotation, an enum class with class' name
 * postfixed with "Fields" is generated. The enum class contains an enum value
 * for each of the fields of the annotated class.
 *
 * <p> E.g. for class {@code MyClass} with a field {@code date}, an enum class
 * {@code MyClassFields} is generated with enum value {@code DATE}.
 *
 * <p> The intention of this is to provide way to switch and loop over each field
 * of a class. Combined with IDE compilation settings (or SpotBugs check)
 * to require explicit handling of each enum value in a switch expression, this
 * ensures that each field is handled and if the annotated class is changed in a way
 * such as field is added, removed or renamed, the IDE will signal an error to be fixed.
